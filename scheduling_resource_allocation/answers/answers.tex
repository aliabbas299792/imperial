  \section{Question 1}
  Everything in this section will use 0-based indexing.
  \subsection{LCL Proof}
  The $Least\ Cost\ Last$ ($LCL$) rule solves the scheduling problem $1 | prec | f_{\text{max}}$ optimally, in $O(n^2)$ time, by constructing
  an optimal schedule from back to front.

  \subsubsection*{Definitions}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $N = \{ 1, 2, \dots, n \}$ is the index set of all jobs
    \item $L \subseteq N$ is the subset of jobs without successors (which can be scheduled last)
    \item $p(S) = \sum_{j \in S} p_j$ is the total processing time of a subset $S$
    \item $f^*_{\text{max}}(S)$ is the cost of the optimal schedule for subset $S$
    \item $f_{\text{max}}$ denotes the maximum (not necessarly optimal) cost across all jobs in a schedule
    \item $f_j(p(N))$ is a cost function which assigns a penalty/cost depending on job $j$ and the time at which the machine has finished processing, $p(N)$
    \begin{itemize}
      \item In the notation of the coursework specification $g_j(\cdot) = f_j(\cdot)$
      \item In the next section we'll use $g_j(C_j) = T_j = \max(0, C_j - d_j)$ (tardiness)
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
  \subsubsection*{Proof and Discussion}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item One job in $L$ must be scheduled last. A job can be
    selected for the final job which minimises $f_j(p(N))$, but it can never result in a cost lower than the cost of the optimal schedule, otherwise that would be the optimal schedule. This is expressed as such: \begin{align*}
      f^*_{\text{max}}(N) \ge \min_{j \in L}f_j (p(N))
    \end{align*}
    \item And removing a job $j \in N$ can't increase the optimal cost any more, since the cost of scheduling a job last is $\ge 0$, so omitting it cannot result in a more expensive schedule: \begin{align*}
      f^*_{\text{max}}(N) \ge f^*_{\text{max}}(N - \{ j \}), \ \forall j \in N
    \end{align*}
    \item We can then select a $J_l \in L$ that minimises $f_j(p(N))$: \begin{align*}
      f_l(p(N)) = \min_{j \in L}f_j(p(N))
    \end{align*}
    Which gives us: \begin{align*}
      f^*_{\text{max}}(N) \ge \max \{ f_l(p(N)), f_{\text{max}}^*(N - \{ l \}) \}
    \end{align*}
    \item The right hand side of the above inequality is the cost of an optimal schedule, where $J_l$ is processed last,
    so you can recursively apply the LCL rule to $N - \{ J_l \}$ and construct a schedule in reverse order
    \begin{itemize}
      \item[-] Since $J_l$ is found in $O(n)$ time, then with $n$, repeated applications of the LCL rule yields the optimal schedule in $O(n^2)$ time
    \end{itemize}
  \end{enumerate}

  You can also show that $LCL$ is optimal by using the \textit{adjacent pairwise interchange argument}:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item You take an optimal schedule $S$ and assume it isn't an $LCL$ schedule
    \item Since it's not an $LCL$ schedule, there must exist at least one pair where a lower cost job precedes a higher cost one
    \item It can then be shown that swapping these jobs yields a lower cost schedule, which is a contradiction since we took an optimal schedule
    \item So by virtue of the fact that a lower cost job can precede a higher cost one leads to a contradiction
    \item And so such pairs cannot exist for an optimal schedule, so we can reject the assumption that this isn't an $LCL$ schedule
    \item And by contradiction then we have that $LCL$ is optimal for $1|prec|f_{\text{max}}$
  \end{itemize}
  
  \subsubsection*{Small Example}
  Example Setup:

    Jobs: J0, J1, J2, J3, J4

    Processing Times: p=[2,3,1,2,3]

    Dude Dates: d=[6,5,7,4,9]

    Precedence Constraints (DAG): J0 $\to$ J1, J0 $\to$ J2, J3 $\to$ J4

    Cost Function: $f_j(C_j) = T_j = max(0, C_j - d_j)$
    
    \paragraph{Iterations}
    We can schedule jobs in reverse order using the $Least\ Cost\ Last$ ($LCL$) rule:
    
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item[0.] Available jobs: $V = \{ 1, 2, 4 \}$ (no successors) \\
      $p(N) = 11$
      \[
      f_{1}(p(N)) = \max(0, 11 - 5) = 6, \quad f_{2}(p(N)) = \max(0, 11 - 4) = 7, \quad f_{4}(p(N)) = \max(0, 11 - 9) = 2
      \]    
      Select $J_{4}$ (minimises $f_j(p(N))$)

      Partial schedule cost: 2

      Updated schedule: $[4]$
        

      \item[1.] Available jobs: $V = \{ 1, 2, 3 \}$ (no successors) \\
      $p(N) = 8$
      \[
      f_{1}(p(N)) = \max(0, 8 - 5) = 3, \quad f_{2}(p(N)) = \max(0, 8 - 4) = 4, \quad f_{3}(p(N)) = \max(0, 8 - 7) = 1
      \]

      \item[2.] Available jobs: $V = \{ 1, 2 \}$ (no successors) \\
      $p(N) = 6$
      \[
      f_{1}(p(N)) = \max(0, 6 - 5) = 1, \quad f_{2}(p(N)) = \max(0, 6 - 4) = 2
      \]    
      Select $J_{1}$ (minimises $f_j(p(N))$)

      Partial schedule cost: 2

      Updated schedule: $[1, 3, 4]$
        

      \item[3.] Available jobs: $V = \{ 2 \}$ (no successors) \\
      $p(N) = 3$
      \[
      f_{2}(p(N)) = \max(0, 3 - 4) = 0
      \]    
      Select $J_{2}$

      Partial schedule cost: 2

      Updated schedule: $[2, 1, 3, 4]$
        

      \item[4.] Available jobs: $V = \{ 0 \}$ (no successors) \\
      $p(N) = 2$
      \[
      f_{0}(p(N)) = \max(0, 2 - 6) = 0
      \]    
      Select $J_{0}$

      Partial schedule cost: 2

      Updated schedule: $[0, 2, 1, 3, 4]$
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \paragraph{Results}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Final schedule: $[J_0, J_2, J_1, J_3, J_4]$
        \item Completion times:
        \[
        C_0 = 2, \, C_2 = 3, \, C_1 = 6, \, C_3 = 8, \, C_4 = 11
        \]
        \item Tardiness:
        \[
        T_0 = 0, \, T_2 = 0, \, T_1 = 1, \, T_3 = 1, \, T_4 = 2
        \]
        \item Maximum cost:
        \[
        f_{\text{max}} = \max(T_0, T_2, T_1, T_3, T_4) = 2
        \]
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{LCL Implementation}
    \paragraph{Iterations}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item[0.] Available jobs: $V = \{ 0, 30 \}$ (no successors) \\
      $p(N) = 170$
      \[
      f_{0}(p(N)) = \max(0, 170 - 172) = 0, \quad f_{30}(p(N)) = \max(0, 170 - 269) = 0
      \]    
      Select $J_{30}$ (minimises $f_j(p(N))$) \\
      Partial schedule cost: 0

      Updated schedule: $[30]$
        

      \item[1.] Available jobs: $V = \{ 0, 1, 10 \}$ (no successors) \\
      $p(N) = 160$
      \[
      f_{0}(p(N)) = \max(0, 160 - 172) = 0, \quad f_{1}(p(N)) = \max(0, 160 - 82) = 78, \quad f_{10}(p(N)) = \max(0, 160 - 253) = 0
      \]    
      Select $J_{0}$ (minimises $f_j(p(N))$) \\
      Partial schedule cost: 0

      Updated schedule: $[0, 30]$

      \item[...]
        

      \item[4.] Available jobs: $V = \{ 1, 4 \}$ (no successors) \\
      $p(N) = 147$
      \[
      f_{1}(p(N)) = \max(0, 147 - 82) = 65, \quad f_{4}(p(N)) = \max(0, 147 - 93) = 54
      \]    
      Select $J_{1}$ (minimises $f_j(p(N))$) \
      Partial schedule cost: 65

      Updated schedule: $[1, 14, 10, 0, 30]$
      
      This iteration was noteable since it incurred the maximum tardiness incurred for this problem.

      \item[...]

      \item[17.] Available jobs: $V = \{ 17, 18, 20, 5 \}$ (no successors) \\
      $p(N) = 68$
      \[
      f_{17}(p(N)) = \max(0, 68 - 77) = 0, \quad f_{18}(p(N)) = \max(0, 68 - 88) = 0,
      \]
      \[
      \quad f_{20}(p(N)) = \max(0, 68 - 71) = 0, \quad f_{5}(p(N)) = \max(0, 68 - 71) = 0
      \] 
      \\   
      Select $J_{17}$ (arbitrarily breaking the tie) \\
      Partial schedule cost: 65

      Updated schedule: $[17, 16, 15, 13, 28, 12, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 11, 4, 1, 14, 10, 0, 30]$

      \item[...]

      \item[30.] Available jobs: $V = \{ 29 \}$ (no successors) \\
      $p(N) = 2$
      \[
      f_{29}(p(N)) = \max(0, 2 - 329) = 0
      \]    
      Select $J_{29}$ (minimises $f_j(p(N))$) \\
      Final schedule cost: 65

      Final schedule: $[29, 9, 8, 3, 2, 7, 6, 22, 21, 5, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 13, 28, 12, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 11, 4, 1, 14, 10, 0, 30]$
    \end{enumerate}

    Note: the tie breaking doesn't specify any ordering in the current implementation (since the set of available jobs is backed by a hash table).

  \section{Question 2}
  \subsection{Tabu Search}
  Throughout this section, I used $\gamma=10$ and $L=20$. I forced the initial solution to be the one specified in the coursework specification.
  
  I also included the first few iterations and all noteable intermediate solutions for each value of $K$.

  \paragraph{Results}
  The best schedule $x_{TS}$ found was:
  \[
    [29, 3, 2, 19, 18, 22, 9, 8, 13, 7, 21, 6, 5, 20, 17, 16, 15, 12, 28, 27, 11, 26, 25, 24, 23, 4, 1, 14, 10, 0, 30]
  \]
  Which had a total tardiness of \textbf{158}.
  Here it seems that the algorithm did effectively converge but the tabu list was not large enough to prevent cycling, as the best solution was found more than once.
  The algorithm could be improved by increasing the tabu list length to prevent revisiting recent states and cycling.

  \subsection{Parameter Exploration and Results}
    The best schedule $x_{TS}$ found was:
    \[
      [29, 3, 2, 9, 8, 7, 6, 22, 19, 5, 18, 21, 13, 20, 17, 16, 15, 12, 28, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 11, 4, 1, 14, 10, 0, 30]
    \]
    with a total tardiness of \textbf{158}.

    \subsubsection*{Parameters Used}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Tabu List Length ($L$)}: 60 - this tabu list length was set to 60 to allow sufficient history to avoid cycling while maintaining exploration flexibility in the neighborhood (up to 29 adjacent swaps)
        \item \textbf{Maximum Iterations ($K$)}: 500 - this value was chosen to ensure the algorithm had enough time to converge to a good solution
        \item \textbf{Threshold for Accepting Worse Solutions ($\gamma$)}: 20 - this value balanced allowing worse solutions to escape local optima and converging efficiently
    \end{itemize}

    \subsubsection*{Parameter Effects}
    \textbf{1. Tabu List Length ($L$):}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item For smaller values of $L$ (e.g., $L=20$), the tabu list wasn't large enough to prevent revisiting recent states, leading to slower improvement, cycling and suboptimal solutions
        \item Increasing $L$ to 60 was good for avoiding cycles and also allowing sufficient exploration of the neighborhood
        \item Larger values of $L$ (e.g., $L=80$) restricted the search too much and occasionally skipped good moves, resulting in worse solutions
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{2. Maximum Iterations ($K$):}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Setting $K$ to 500 allowed the algorithm to converge fully, in fact it only needed 374 iterations
        \item Reducing $K$ (e.g., $K=200$) often resulted in suboptimal solutions, as the search terminated prematurely before the algorithm could escape local optima
        \item Increasing $K$ beyond 500 did not result in significant improvements but increased runtime unnecessarily, and for cases where the tabu list was small, it just cycled
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{3. Threshold for Accepting Worse Solutions ($\gamma$):}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Smaller values of $\gamma$ (e.g., $\gamma=10$) caused the algorithm to become stuck in local optima, as fewer worse solutions were accepted, reducing exploration
        \item Larger values of $\gamma$ (e.g., $\gamma=30$) allowed too much exploration, which slowed convergence and resulted in noisy search behavior (i.e. frequent fluctuations), but did sometimes find better solutions
        \item $\gamma=20$ provided a good tradeoff between exploration and exploitation, letting the algorithm escape local optima while still converging efficiently
    \end{itemize}

    \subsubsection*{Edge Case Analysis}
    When \(L < 30\), the tabu list is too small to avoid revisits, which lead to slower improvement and cycling.
    For \(L > 80\), excessive restrictions on moves resulted in skipped promising neighbors and worse solutions.
    Setting \(K < 300\) often terminated the search prematurely before escaping local optima, while increasing \(K\) beyond
    500 provided diminishing returns with no significant improvement in tardiness.
    
    \subsubsection*{Limitations}
    The tabu search implementation performs well for the given problem size, but its efficiency may degrade for
    significantly larger DAGs or job counts. The parameter tuning process relied on manual exploration and could benefit
    from automated methods, such as Bayesian optimisation using a tool like Optuna. Additionally, revisiting solutions and
    cycling occasionally occurred when \(L\) was not large enough.

    \subsubsection*{Conclusion}
    The best schedule was found with $L=60$, $K=500$, and $\gamma=20$, achieving a total tardiness of \textbf{158}.
    These parameters provided a good balance between avoiding cycling, allowing sufficient exploration, and converging efficiently.
    Parameter tuning revealed that values for $L$ and $\gamma$ which were too small or too large degraded performance,
    and $K$ needed to be just large enough to allow full convergence without unnecessary runtime overhead.
